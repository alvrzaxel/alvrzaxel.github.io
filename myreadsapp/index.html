                include the cover image, title, and a brief description. These

                When a user selects a book, the app provides a detailed view

            <p>
              The MVVM architecture clearly separates the user interface,
              presentation logic, and business logic. In this pattern, the
              ViewModel retrieves data from the repository, which manages data
              access. The ViewModel transforms this data for use in the View.
              This separation allows the View to focus on presentation, while
              the ViewModel handles data access and processing logic, enhancing
              the applicationâs maintainability and scalability.

                  The repository handles data access and provides methods to the
                  ViewModel. The <span class="bold-text">ViewModel</span> uses
                  these methods to fetch data, while the repository manages
                  communication with the datasource. This separation keeps the
                  ViewModel focused on presentation logic and the repository on
                  data management, improving code modularity and maintenance.

                  The datasource handles direct interaction with Firestore to
                  retrieve user data. It provides methods for data access,
                  abstracting the complexity of read and write operations. The
                  repository uses these methods to fetch data, which is then
                  managed by the ViewModel. This abstraction simplifies data
                  handling in higher layers by hiding the details of data
                  access.

              Building this app has been an incredibly rewarding experience.
              While my main goal was to learn and enjoy the development
              process, I must admit that, instead of helping me organize my
              reading and read more, the app has had the opposite effect! Now
              I have an app to manage my reading, so I plan to dive back into
              books immediately!

                I recognize that the app still has much to be polished: from
                adjusting functions and designs to refining details and possibly
                reorganizing parts of the code for better structure. Iâm open to
                any suggestions or constructive criticism and would love to
                receive feedback on my GitHub code. Iâm eager to continue
                learning and improving, so please feel free to propose any
                enhancements.
