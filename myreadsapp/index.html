              their email and password or through Google and Apple
              authentication. The integration with Firebase Authentication

              the cover image, title, and a brief description. These data are

                The MVVM architecture clearly separates the user interface,
                presentation logic, and business logic. In this pattern, the
                ViewModel retrieves data from the repository, which manages data
                access. The ViewModel transforms this data for use in the View.
                This separation allows the View to focus on presentation, while
                the ViewModel handles data access and processing logic, enhancing
                the application‚Äôs maintainability and scalability.

                  The repository handles data access and provides methods to the
                    ViewModel. The ViewModel uses these methods to fetch data,
                    while the repository manages communication with the
                    datasource. This separation keeps the ViewModel focused on
                    presentation logic and the repository on data management,
                    improving code modularity and maintenance.

                  The datasource handles direct interaction with Firestore to
                    retrieve user data. It provides methods for data access,
                    abstracting the complexity of read and write operations. The
                    repository uses these methods to fetch data, which is then
                    managed by the ViewModel. This abstraction simplifies data
                    handling in higher layers by hiding the details of data
                    access.

              Building this app has been an incredibly rewarding experience.
              While my main goal was to learn and enjoy the development process,
              I must admit that, instead of helping me organize my reading and
              read more, the app has had the opposite effect! Now I have an app
              to manage my reading, so I plan to dive back into books
              immediately!

                  I recognize that the app still has much to be polished: from
                  adjusting functions and designs to refining details and possibly
                  reorganizing parts of the code for better structure. I‚Äôm open to
                  any suggestions or constructive criticism and would love to
                  receive feedback on my GitHub code. I‚Äôm eager to continue
